### Gameplay

The objective is simple: beat the computer by making the right moves! The game is set for a maximum of 10 moves. You will be presented with the computer's move, and you have to choose whether you want to **Win** or **Lose** against it. Select your move by tapping on the corresponding button â€“ **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.

### Scoring

- If you choose the move that beats the computer's move, you gain a point.
- If you choose the move that loses to the computer's move, you lose a point.
- In case of a tie, neither player gains or loses a point.

### Keep an Eye on the Clock!

With only 10 moves allowed, you'll need to make strategic choices to maximize your score. Think fast, but think wisely!
